Company Management
As a company responsible, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your company. You can add your company information, update it when needed, and delete it when no longer required.

Request Management
Once you have joined a company as an employee, you can add requests such as time requests or money requests. After submitting a request, the admin of the company can either accept or reject the request. This feature helps to keep track of employee requests and enables companies to make informed decisions.
